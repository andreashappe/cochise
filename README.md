# Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks?

***Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks***

The title is quite a handful, I know..

I have been working on [hackingBuddyGPT](https://github.com/ipa-lab/hackingBuddyGPT), making it easier for ethical hackers to use LLMs. My main focus are single-host linux systems and privilege-escalation attacks within them.

When OpenAI opened up API access to its o1 model on January, 24th 2025 and I saw the massive quality improvement over GPT-4o, one of my initial thoughts was "could this be used for more-complex pen-testing tasks.. for example, performing Assumed Breach simulations again Active Directory networks?"

To evaluate the LLM's capabilities I set up the great [GOADv3](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD) testbed and wrote the simple prototype that you're currenlty looking at. This work is only intended to be used against security testbeds, never against real system (you know, as long as we do not understand how AI decision-making happens, you wouldn't want to use an LLM for taking potentially destructive decisions).

**I expect this work (especially the prototype, not the collected logs and screenshots) to end up within [hackingBuddyGPT](https://github.com/ipa-lab/hackingBuddyGPT) eventually.**
