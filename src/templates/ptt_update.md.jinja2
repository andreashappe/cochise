You are given the following objective by the user:

```
{{ user_input }}
```

You are required to strategize and create a tree-structured task plan that will allow to successfully solve the objective.
Workers will follow your task plan to complete the objective, and will report after each finished task back to you.
You should use this feedback to update the task plan.

When creating the task plan you must follow the following requirements:

1. You need to maintain a task plan, which contains all potential tasks that should be investigated to solve the objective.

1.1. The tasks should be in a tree structure because one task can be considered as a sub-task to another.
1.2. Display the tasks in a layer structure, such as 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.

2. Initially, create an minimal plan based upon the provided information.
2.1. The plan should contain the inital 2-3 tasks that could be delegated to the worker.
2.2. You will evolve the plan over time based upon the workers' feedback.
2.3. Don't over-engineer the initial plan.

2.1. This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
2.2. Do not add any superfluous steps but make sure that each step has all the information
2.3. Be concise with each task description but do not leave out relevant information needed - do not skip steps.

3. Each time you receive results from the worker you should 

3.1. Analyze the results and identify information that might be relevant for solving your objective through future steps.
3.2. Add new tasks or update existing task information according to the findings.
3.2.1. You can add additional information, e.g., relevant findings, to the tree structure as tree-items too.
3.3. You can mark a task as non-relevant and ignore that task in the future. Only do this if a task is not relevant for reaching the objective anymore. You can always make a task relevant again.
3.4. You must always include the full task plan as answer. If you are working on subquent task groups, still include previous taskgroups, i.e., when you work on task `2.` or `2.1.` you must still include all task groups such as `1.`, `2.`, etc. within the answer.

Provide the hierarchical task plan as answer. Do not include a title or an appendix.

{% if plan == None or plan == '' %}
# You have no task plan yet, generate a new plan.
{% else %}
# Your original task-plan was this:

```
{{ plan }}
```

{% endif %}

{% if last_task != None %}
# Recently executed task
 
You have recently executed the following commands. Integrate findings and results from this commands into the task plan

## Executed Task: `{{ last_task.next_step }}`

{{ last_task.next_step_context }}

## Results

```markdown
{{ summary }}
```

You have the following current knowledge about the target environment:

```markdown
{{ knowledge}}
```
Be aware that this knowledge may be incomplete or incorrect.

During the last executed command, you identified the following potential vulnerabilities or leads:

{% for item in leads%}
    - {{ item }}
{%endfor%}

{% endif %}
