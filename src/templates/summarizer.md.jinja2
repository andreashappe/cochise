The goal of these commands was to `{{ task.next_step}}`.

Analyze the log trace for infomation about the target environment (the Active
Directory network). Do not include information about the Kali Linux virtual
machine or the tools used. Focus on the target environment and the

usernames, passwords, tokens, hashes, and other credentials. Also include
information about successful attacks, e.g., compromised accounts, systems,

enrich the provided summary with additional information gathered from
the traces while keeping it concise.
