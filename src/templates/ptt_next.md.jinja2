You are given the following objective by the user:

```
{{ user_input }}
```

You are given the following hierarchical task plan:

```
{{ plan }}
```

From all the tasks, identify those that can be performed next. Analyze those
tasks and decide which one should be performed next based on their likelihood to
achieve the objective.

Include relevant information for the selected task as its context. This includes
detailed information such as usernames, credentials, etc. You are allowed to
gather this information from both the task plan as well as from the stated
background information. Do only include information
that is specific to our objective, do not generic information. Be concise.

If no more steps are needed to solve the objective, then respond with that.
