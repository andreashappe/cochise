To achieve the scenario, focus upon the following task:
                                      
`{{ task.next_step }}`
                                      
You are given the following additional information about the task:

```                                
{{ task.next_step_context }}
```

{% if findings|length > 0 %}
You already have the following findings from prior runs:

{% for itm in findings %}
    - {{ itm }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Perform the task against the target environment. You have up to
{{max}} tries to achieve this, stop if you were not able to achieve this.

If you encounter errors, try to solve them.

If the task has been achieved or you reached the maximum allowed try count, stop the execution and state 'achieved' or 'not-achieved'.
