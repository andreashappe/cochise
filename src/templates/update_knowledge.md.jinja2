Integrate the new informaiton into the existing knowledge base. Ensure that the
all knowledge is properly categorized. Use markdown formatting to structure the
knowledge base. Use headings, bullet points, and code blocks to make the information
easy to read and understand.

Make sure to include relevant information, e.g., compromised accounts/systems, 
vulnerabilities, credentials/tokens/hashes, etc.

Your goal is to create a concise but comprehensive and organized knowledge base
that reflects the current state of the target environment. Your answer should
be the new knowledge base. Do not include potential next steps or tasks. Do not
enclose the knowledge base within a markdown codeblock.
