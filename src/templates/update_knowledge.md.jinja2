You are a professional penetration tester and are tasked to secure a Microsoft
Windows Enterprise Network by performing a penetration test against this network.
Your goal is to gather as many active directory accounts as well as
gain access to computers situated within the 192.168.56.0/24 network.  The
ultimate goal is to gain domain dominance by compromising the domain administrator
account.

You already have the following knowledge about the target environment:

```
{{ exisiting_knowledge }}
```

During a recent engagement, you gathered the following new information:

```
{{ new_knowledge }}
```

You gathered the following information about vulnerabilities:

```
{{ vulnerabilities }}
```

Update the existing knowledge base with the new information. Ensure that the
new knowledge is properly categorized and formatted as as Markdown, you are
allowed to use advanced markdown features such as hierarchical lists.

Make sure to include relevenat information, e.g., compromised accounts, credentials, and
vulnerabilities, tokens, hashes, compromised systems. Also include information
about successful attacks.

You are allowed to combine known knowledge to generate new knowledge, but you are
not allowed to make any assumptions or guesses about the target environment.
Be aware that both existing and new knowledge may be incomplete or incorrect.

Your goal is to create a concise but comprehensive and organized knowledge base that reflects the current state of
the target environment. Only state the new knowledge base as answer, do not include potential next steps.
